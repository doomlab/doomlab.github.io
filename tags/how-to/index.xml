      <title>formr Round 3: No nginx Required</title>

      <description>Alright folks! I am back with more installation guides. I&amp;rsquo;ve installed formr so many times at this point &amp;hellip; since my first post, opencpu has updated to R 4+, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to not use nginx. Which is good news, since it often conflicts with also running apache. I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave the old guides up because maybe they can help someone figure out their issues, but here goes with the newest guide.</description>

      <title>Installing RStudio Server &#43; Updates</title>

      <description>One of the most difficult things I try to teach my students is how to deal with error messages. Due to Hurricane Laura, I am currently re-creating several projects including formr, RStudio, and a website. I thought I would detail that here.
You can find my first post on formr here: https://www.aggieerin.com/post/formr-installation-instructions/
Good news! It’s mostly the same and pretty smooth. However, I sometimes get this nonsense: installation of package ‘psych’ had non-zero exit status - any time you get the non-zero exit status message, it requires a careful look at the installation messages.</description>

      <description>An installation guide taken from formr documentation and modified to include more details for those who need it.
These installation instructions are provided for Ubuntu 18.04; however, they could be modified for other systems. The original instructions suggest Debian 9, but I found this much easier on Ubuntu. I have now used both Digital Ocean and Amazon Lightsail for this installation. I don’t think the product matters, but the size of the machine is likely something you should focus on.</description>

      <description>Hey everybody!
The last couple days I have been trying to learn LASSO regression, which stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I have several datasets with many variables, and I thought these would be a good opportunity to learn about how to lasso, while maybe answering a few questions about words.
Right, the part I forgot about is that I have repeated measures data, which always complicates things.</description>

      <title>Getting Translations with rvest and Selenium</title>

      <description>In this guide, I’ll go over how you can use web scraping rvest and Selenium to get translations from Google Translate. Note: I encourage responsible scraping - I always try to do it with some space between requests. You can only do 5000 characters at a time with the free Google translate. I will say that I tried to do this with just rvest and the predictability of the links for Google translate - but I could not get rvest to pull the right data off the page, so here’s a slightly more difficult approach that appears to work.</description>

      <description>Hi guys! I have finally done it! I updated my CV with Rmarkdown using Steve&amp;rsquo;s Markdown Templates. I was tempted to use the new vitae package, but I had already gone down this path before that came out, just finally getting back to it.
Link to the entire CV folder for you to use/view do stuff with: CV. Please ignore the html files in that folder, it does &amp;ldquo;knit&amp;rdquo; automatically as part of the website build using markdown - you should be using PDF and LaTex for the CV part.</description>

      <description>Hey everybody! I am back and finally getting to videos again. I hesistate to say “it’s been crazy!” because I feel like that’s always a thing that academics say, but I will say I’ve had a lot of life going on, and I am finally getting back to a normal amount of crazy.
I’ve decided to do some simple videos to start - so I am creating how-to videos to go with our JASP guides we created this summer.</description>
