      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s be four years since the last formr update! Good grief. I am building a new server for PSA research projects, so I thought I would share the latest updates and installs for those who want it for their own use. I will also note that the formr dudes recommend docker installation as shown here: https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr_dev_docker. My luck with docker is so-so, so here&amp;rsquo;s my guide for manual install. Further, their warning about &amp;ldquo;no production&amp;rdquo; makes me quite nervous.</description>

      <title>formr Round 3: No nginx Required</title>

      <description>Alright folks! I am back with more installation guides. I&amp;rsquo;ve installed formr so many times at this point &amp;hellip; since my first post, opencpu has updated to R 4+, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to not use nginx. Which is good news, since it often conflicts with also running apache. I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave the old guides up because maybe they can help someone figure out their issues, but here goes with the newest guide.</description>

      <title>formr Installation Instructions</title>

      <description>An installation guide taken from formr documentation and modified to include more details for those who need it.
These installation instructions are provided for Ubuntu 18.04; however, they could be modified for other systems. The original instructions suggest Debian 9, but I found this much easier on Ubuntu. I have now used both Digital Ocean and Amazon Lightsail for this installation. I donâ€™t think the product matters, but the size of the machine is likely something you should focus on.</description>
