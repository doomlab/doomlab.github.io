      <description>Here, you can learn about our goal of making statistical analysis approachable by creating a plethora of learning materials and interactive environment for learning/improving your skills.
Shiny Apps: I have been working on building interactive applications through Shiny to visualize the data for specific projects and to increase statistical skills by creating easy ways to calculate numbers for non-programming researchers. I try to post about the applications as we put them online, but you can find them on our shiny-server GitHub repository or through the shiny tag on the blog.</description>
