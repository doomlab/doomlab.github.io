### Statistics Outreach

*Statistics Certificate*: I designed a statistics and research methods graduate certificate for Missouri State University. I coordinated the program, working with students to ensure they've completed the requirements in a way that matches their long-term goals. Certificate requirement are one graduate statistics course, one research methods course, and two other electives in statistics or research based courses. 
	
*In-Person/Online Help Desk*: The Psychology Help Desk was designed as small group tutoring/help opportunity for our statistics and research methods courses (approximately 1,500 students annually). The Help Desk holds regular open hours to accommodate students who need assistance with program or math related questions. The online Help Desk was created to reach our busy, non-traditional, and online students. I supervised the graduate assistant and practicum students who hold open hours. I trained these students, as well as create materials for the online portion of the Help Desk. The graduate assistant answered a special email box for the Help Desk and provides assistance through a special Blackboard portal. The Blackboard site was used to link students to appropriate materials, contact information for the Help Desk, and email out information as necessary.

*YouTube*: My YouTube channel contains many hours of tutorials on how to complete statistical procedures in SPSS, Excel, *R*, MOTE, and G*Power. This information is used as teaching material in my courses and is open access for students/researchers to use as needed. I respond to online questions about these materials and take requests for video material. 

*MOTE*: MOTE is a free *R* package and online app that calculates effect sizes and their non-central confidence intervals. This package was designed to fill the gap between running hypothesis testing calculations and effect sizes for students in a simple format – while also adding in confidence intervals for effect sizes because of the promotion for these values in reporting. 

*StatsTools*: The Statistics Tools or Statistics of DOOM website ties all these resources together in one convenient location. Materials from my courses (basic/advanced/graduate statistics and structural equation modeling) are provided with multiple formats (SPSS, Excel, *R*) for use by students in my courses and the interested graduate student or researcher. This information is formatted so that an individual may download the entire course for a template when assigned as a course prep.
